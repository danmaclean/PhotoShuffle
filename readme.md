This script will programmatically reorganise photographs from an ad-hoc mess to something structured: using the EXIF information from each file and use the creation time of each image as key to organise each image into the directory structure Year/Month/Day.  If an image file is missing EXIF data then the fileâ€™s creation time can be used instead via an option.

An example of running this script to reoranise the photos folder and leave the original files in place would be:
    python PhotoShuffle.py -copy /Users/Daniel/Pictures /Users/Daniel/OrganisedPictures

An example of running this script to reoranise the photos folder would be:
    python PhotoShuffle.py /Users/Daniel/Pictures /Users/Daniel/OrganisedPictures

The ExifScan.py script can also be ran directly to scan and harvest EXIF data from image files in a directory tree and write a CSV formatted report for analysis.  For example to find the creation time for all files in the photos folder, run the following:
    python ExifScan.py DateTimeOriginal DateTime

To find only the files without the DateTimeOriginal tag run the following:
    python ExifScan.py -nodata DateTimeOriginal
